# Claude Code - User Memory (Global Settings)

**Version**: 3.0 | **Last Updated**: October 2025 | **Scope**: All Projects

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Shift Knowledge from Context to Retrieval**—making all project intelligence persistent, structured, and instantly accessible via targeted retrieval (scouting/planning agents) rather than relying on the limited AI context window.

**R&D Framework** (Reduce and Delegate):
- Use token-efficient models for discovery and boilerplate
- Delegate to specialized tools (Gemini, Codex, Chrome DevTools)
- Reserve Claude for complex logic and architecture
- Achieve 90%+ token efficiency

---

## 🤖 Tool Delegation Strategy (Universal)

### Task Routing Matrix

| Task Type | Tool | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Read docs, summarize | Gemini MCP | Fast, cheap tokens |
| Boilerplate, configs | Codex MCP | Quick syntax, no context needed |
| Fix syntax bugs | Codex MCP | Immediate, no architectural context |
| UI/UX work | Codex MCP | Specializes in component code |
| Complex debugging (multi-file) | Claude | Requires architectural understanding |
| Architectural decisions | Claude | Strategic, long-term impact |
| Security/performance review | Claude | Critical, requires deep analysis |
| E2E testing | Chrome DevTools MCP | Testing specialty |

### Decision Tree

```
Step 1: Identify scope
  - Single file bug? → Codex MCP
  - Multi-file bug? → Claude
  - Config/env issue? → Codex MCP
  - Logic/architecture? → Claude

Step 2: Choose workflow by project scale
  - Small (<10 files): Direct implementation
  - Medium (10-50 files): /scout_plan_build
  - Large (>50 files): /scout_plan_build

Step 3: Execute with minimal context
  - Read ONLY affected files
  - Use grep for targeted searches
  - Avoid reading entire directories
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Pre-Implementation Protocol

**BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES, Claude must:**

1. ✅ **Read project documentation** (via Gemini MCP)
   - `app-docs/specs/[round-type]-[feature].md` if exists
   - `app-docs/guides/implementation-guidelines.md`
   - `app-docs/mappings/feature-to-source.md` (create if missing)

2. ✅ **Check existing patterns**
   ```bash
   # Search for similar implementations
   grep -r "pattern_keyword" app/
   grep -r "related_feature" app-docs/mappings/
   ```

3. ✅ **Confirm approach with user**
   ```markdown
   📋 Implementation Approach:

   Files to modify: [list]
   New files: [list]
   Pattern: [from app-docs/guides/]
   Token estimate: [breakdown]
   Risks: [identified risks + mitigation]

   Proceed? (yes/no)
   ```

4. ⏸️ **WAIT for explicit user approval**

**Never skip this for "efficiency" - it saves tokens by preventing wrong approaches.**

---

## 🛠️ Development Workflow (Universal)

### Workflow Selection by Project Scale

**Small Projects** (<10 files, <5K LOC):
```
User: "Add health check endpoint"
Claude: [uses Codex MCP directly]
✅ Done in ~10K tokens
```

**Medium Projects** (10-50 files, 5K-20K LOC):
```bash
/scout_plan_build "Add user authentication" ""
# Scout (10K) → Plan (30K) → Build + Report (40K) = ~80K total
```

**Large Projects** (>50 files, >20K LOC):
```bash
/scout_plan_build "Implement OAuth2" "https://oauth.net/2/"
# Scout (10K) → Plan (30K) → Build (50K) → Report (5K) = ~95K total
```



### Post-Deployment Validation

```bash
# Always run after deployment
./scripts/health-check/health-check.sh

# Validates:
# - Service ports
# - HTTP endpoints
# - Database connectivity
# - Resource usage
```

---

## 📋 Code Quality Standards (Universal)

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests**: >80% coverage on business logic
- **Integration tests**: API, database, external services
- **E2E tests**: Critical user flows (use Chrome DevTools MCP)

### Security Checklist
- [ ] No secrets in version control (.env + .gitignore)
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- [ ] Authentication on protected routes
- [ ] Rate limiting on public APIs
- [ ] HTTPS in production
- [ ] Regular dependency audits (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Principle of least privilege

### Code Organization Principles
- **File size**: Target 300-500 lines per file
- **DRY**: Reuse patterns, don't reinvent
- **Separation of concerns**: Data, logic, presentation
- **Named constants**: No magic numbers
- **Complete solutions**: No placeholders or TODOs without issues

---

## 🎯 Documentation Standards (Universal)

### Required Documentation

**Every project needs:**
1. **CLAUDE.md** (from template) - Project memory
2. **README.md** - Setup, usage, quick reference
3. **app-docs/specs/** - Feature specifications
4. **app-docs/guides/** - Implementation patterns
5. **app-docs/mappings/feature-to-source.md** (create if missing) - File locations

### Documentation Workflow

**Before implementation:**
- Write spec in `app-docs/specs/[feature].md`
- Run `/plan` which reads spec automatically
- Get user approval

**After implementation:**
- `/report` phase auto-updates:
  - `app-docs/mappings/feature-to-source.md` (create if missing)
  - `README.md` (if needed)
  - Architecture docs (if structural changes)

**Never:**
- Duplicate information across docs
- Write docs without testing first
- Let docs get out of sync (use pre-commit hooks)

---

## 💡 Debugging Protocol (Universal)

### Step 1: Identify Scope (30 seconds, no AI)

```
Single file? → Codex MCP
Multi-file? → Claude
Config issue? → Codex MCP
Logic error? → Claude
```

### Step 2: Gather Minimal Context

```
- Read ONLY affected files
- Use grep for targeted searches
- Check app-docs/debugging/known-issues.md
- Review recent git commits
```

### Step 3: Execute Fix

```
Codex MCP:
  - Syntax errors
  - Type mismatches
  - Config file edits
  - Simple logic fixes

Claude:
  - Complex integration bugs
  - Architectural issues
  - Multi-file refactoring
  - Performance optimization
```

### Step 4: Validate

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Check linting
npm run lint

# Manual testing
curl http://localhost:3000/[endpoint]

# Review git diff
git diff --stat
```

---

## 🚀 Token Optimization Rules

1.  **Token Budget Detection**: Run a project scale check on every new task to determine the appropriate workflow (Small  Direct, Medium  /scout_build, Large  /scout_plan_build_report).
2.  **CRITICAL Pre-Implementation Protocol**: **NEVER skip the pre-approval phase.** This is the primary token gate. The AI must present its **Files to modify, Pattern, Token estimate, and Risks** and **WAIT for explicit user approval** before touching code.
3.  **Delegate Documentation Reading**: Use cheaper tools (like Gemini MCP) to summarize or read documentation and specs. **Do not waste Claude's tokens on reading large documentation files.**
4.  **Avoid Directory Reading**: The AI should **never** read an entire directory (e.g., src/). It must rely exclusively on the **scouting phase** and the **feature-to-source.md mapping file** to find the minimal required context.

---

## 📊 Metrics & Continuous Improvement

### Track Token Usage

All workflows log to: `ai-docs/logs/workflow-metrics.jsonl`

```bash
# Check efficiency weekly
cat ai-docs/logs/workflow-metrics.jsonl | jq '.efficiency' | tail -10

# Target: >90% average efficiency
# If lower, review tool delegation strategy
```

### Learn from Each Workflow

After every workflow, check report for:
- ✅ What worked well
- ⚠️ What could improve
- 🚀 Try next time

**Update your patterns:**
- Add successful patterns to `app-docs/guides/`
- Document common bugs in `app-docs/debugging/`
- Adjust token budgets based on actual usage

---

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant & Enterprise Patterns

### When Planning SaaS Features

1. **Business requirements first**
   - Tenant isolation strategy
   - Pricing tiers
   - Data residency

2. **Technical architecture**
   - Database design (shared vs isolated)
   - API authentication (tenant context)
   - Row-level security

3. **Security checklist**
   - [ ] Tenant data isolation (automated tests)
   - [ ] Audit logging (with tenant ID)
   - [ ] Compliance documentation (SOC 2, GDPR)
   - [ ] Rate limiting (per tenant)
   - [ ] Cross-tenant data leakage prevention

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### DON'T Use AI For

**Manual tasks that are faster:**
- Checking port availability (`lsof -i :80`)
- Validating JSON syntax (`jq . < file.json`)
- Counting files (`find app/ -type f | wc -l`)
- Git operations (`git status`, `git diff`)

**One-time setups:**
- Environment variable configuration (edit .env manually)
- API key management (don't share with AI)
- Simple file renames (use `mv` command)

### DON'T Skip Steps

**Never skip pre-approval:**
- Even for "simple" tasks
- Saves tokens by catching wrong approaches
- User knows their project better than AI

**Never skip testing:**
- Run test suite after changes
- Manual testing for user-facing features
- Performance testing for critical paths

**Never skip documentation:**
- Update README if commands changed
- Update app-docs/mappings/ for new features
- Add to app-docs/debugging/ if issues found

## 📞 When Things Go Wrong

### Token Budget Exceeded

```
1. Check: ai-docs/logs/workflow-metrics.jsonl
2. Identify: Which phase used most tokens?
3. Optimize:
   - Scout: Reduce scale (4 → 2 agents)
   - Plan: Simplify scope
   - Build: More Codex/Gemini, less Claude
4. Retry with adjusted approach
```

### Tests Failing After Build

```
1. Don't retry immediately
2. Read: ai-docs/builds/[latest]/build-report.md
3. Identify: Which specific task caused failure
4. Fix: Use appropriate tool for that task
5. Re-run: Only that task, not entire build
```

### Scout Found No Files

```
1. Lower scale: /scout "[task]" "2"
2. Or manual: List files yourself
3. Skip to plan: /plan_w_docs "[task]" "" "[manual-files]"
4. Learn: Add patterns to app-docs/guides/
```

### User Rejected Plan

```
1. Good! Pre-approval working as intended
2. Ask user: What to change?
3. Revise approach based on feedback
4. Re-run plan phase
5. Document: Why original approach was wrong
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**You're using this correctly when:**

✅ Token efficiency >90% across all workflows
✅ Pre-approval catches issues before coding
✅ Documentation stays in sync automatically
✅ Patterns are reused across projects
✅ You can handle 3+ enterprise projects simultaneously
✅ Weekly token limits are sufficient
✅ Clear audit trail for all changes

**Warning signs:**

⚠️ Frequently hitting token limits
⚠️ Tests failing after builds
⚠️ Documentation out of sync
⚠️ Repeating same work across projects
⚠️ Pre-approval usually gets rejected
⚠️ Not using MCP tools (all Claude)

---

## 🔄 Quarterly Review

**Every 3 months, review:**

1. **Token efficiency trends**
   ```bash
   cat ai-docs/logs/workflow-metrics.jsonl | \
     jq '.efficiency' | \
     awk '{sum+=$1; count++} END {print sum/count}'
   ```

2. **Most effective tools**
   - Which tool has highest success rate?
   - Which saves most tokens?
   - Are we using the right tool for each task?

3. **Pattern reuse**
   - What patterns were added to app-docs/guides/?
   - Are they being reused?
   - What new patterns are needed?

4. **Update this document**
   - New learnings from past 3 months
   - Tool delegation strategy changes
   - Updated best practices
