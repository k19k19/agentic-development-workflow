Automation drops session artifacts here. Treat everything as disposable unless a command tells you otherwise.

- `plans/` – Plans generated by `/plan` or `/full`.
- `builds/` – Build logs and test output.
- `sessions/` – Session summaries written after each build command.
- `tasks/` – Token + task ledger managed via `npm run tasks:*`.
- `knowledge-ledger/` – Optional hand-written notes (indexed by `npm run vectorize`).

After a build completes the command already ran:
1. `npm run vectorize`
2. `npm run tasks:session-start`

If you clean up old folders, re-run `npm run vectorize` so the embeddings stay current.
