Automation drops session artifacts here. Treat everything as disposable unless a command tells you otherwise.

- `plans/` – Plans generated by `/plan` or `/full`.
- `builds/` – Build logs and test output.
- `sessions/` – Session summaries written after each build command.
- `workflow/` – Per-command status JSON plus the aggregated `status-index.json` used by the dashboard (generated on demand).
- `workflow/cross-session-prompt.md` *(optional)* – Create this if you want a lightweight hand-off prompt to carry between sessions.
- `workflow/tasks.json` *(optional)* – Add this when you need backlog metadata for `npm run tasks:session-start`.
- `knowledge-ledger/` – Optional hand-written notes to revisit in future sessions.

After completing a command, run `npm run workflow:sync` to refresh the aggregated index before opening the dashboard.
