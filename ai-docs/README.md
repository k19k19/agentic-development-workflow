Automation drops session artifacts here. Treat everything as disposable unless a command tells you otherwise.

- `plans/` – Plans generated by `/plan` or `/full`.
- `builds/` – Build logs and test output.
- `sessions/` – Session summaries written after each build command.
- `workflow/` – Per-command status JSON plus the aggregated `status-index.json` used by the dashboard.
- `workflow/cross-session-prompt.md` – Lightweight prompt carried across sessions; keep it lean to avoid context overflow.
- `workflow/tasks.json` – Optional backlog metadata used by `npm run tasks:session-start` for budget-aware recommendations.
- `knowledge-ledger/` – Optional hand-written notes to revisit in future sessions.

After completing a command, run `npm run workflow:sync` to refresh the aggregated index before opening the dashboard.
