# Scout Results: Fleet Management Software Research

**Feature ID:** fleet-management-research
**Scout Date:** 2025-10-12
**Objective:** Research what makes good fleet management software

---

## Executive Summary

This scout phase investigated the requirements, architecture, and best practices for building modern fleet management software. The research reveals that successful systems combine real-time telematics, driver management, predictive maintenance, and compliance tracking into a unified platform optimized for safety, cost reduction, and operational efficiency.

## 1. Core Feature Requirements

### Essential Functionality (MVP)
- **Real-time GPS tracking** with live map visualization
- **Trip history & replay** with detailed route logs
- **Driver management** (profiles, licenses, certifications, assignments)
- **Vehicle inventory** (VIN, registration, make/model, maintenance records)
- **Preventive maintenance scheduling** (mileage/time-based reminders)
- **Fuel management** (consumption tracking, fuel card integration)
- **Basic reporting** (mileage, idle time, speeding, stops)
- **Geofencing** (virtual perimeters with entry/exit alerts)

### Advanced Differentiators
- **Advanced telematics** via OBD-II/CAN bus (DTCs, engine hours, fuel levels)
- **Predictive maintenance** using AI/ML to forecast component failures
- **Driver behavior scoring** (harsh braking, acceleration, cornering)
- **Video telematics** (AI dashcams with event-triggered recording)
- **Route optimization & dispatching** (multi-stop algorithms with traffic)
- **ELD/HOS compliance** for commercial trucking
- **EV fleet support** (state of charge, charging stations)
- **Temperature monitoring** for refrigerated cargo

---

## 2. Technical Architecture Considerations

### Scalability Requirements
- **Cloud-native microservices** (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- **Message queues** (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for high-frequency device data
- **Scalable databases** designed for thousands of devices reporting every few seconds
- **Real-time stream processing** (Apache Flink, Spark Streaming)

### Integration Points
| Integration Type | Examples | Purpose |
|------------------|----------|---------|
| GPS Hardware | CalAmp, Teltonika | Device data ingestion |
| Fuel Cards | WEX, FleetCor | Automated transaction import |
| ERP/CRM | Salesforce, SAP | Customer/job sync |
| Maintenance | External work order systems | Service coordination |

### Mobile App Requirements
- **Native or high-performance cross-platform** (React Native, Flutter)
- **Offline functionality** for poor connectivity areas
- **Large touch targets** for driver safety
- **Minimal distraction** design principles

### API Design Patterns
- **RESTful or GraphQL APIs** with comprehensive documentation
- **Webhooks** for real-time event notifications (more efficient than polling)
- **API-first architecture** to support third-party integrations

## 3. Data Model & Management

### Key Entities & Relationships
```
Fleet
  ├─ Vehicles (many)
  │   ├─ Trips (many)
  │   ├─ MaintenanceLogs (many)
  │   ├─ FuelRecords (many)
  │   └─ TelematicsEvents (many)
  └─ Drivers (many)
      ├─ Trips (many)
      ├─ HOSLogs (many)
      └─ SafetyEvents (many)

Trip
  └─ RoutePoints (many) [timestamped GPS coordinates]

Geofence
  └─ GeofenceEvents (many)
```

### Data Retention Strategy
- **Hot storage** (1-2 years): Recent trip data, active maintenance records
- **Cold storage** (AWS Glacier): Historical archives
- **Compliance minimum**: HOS logs must retain 6+ months per FMCSA

### Reporting & Analytics
- **Customizable dashboards** with user-built widgets
- **Trend analysis** over time (fuel efficiency, safety scores)
- **Benchmarking** against anonymized industry data
- **Audit trail** for all data changes

---

## 4. User Experience Principles

### Dashboard Design
- **Information hierarchy**: Critical alerts/issues visible immediately
- **Map-centric interface** with intelligent vehicle clustering
- **Actionable insights**: "Idle Time: 4 hours (Cost: $80)" vs raw data

### Role-Based Access Control
| Role | Access Level |
|------|--------------|
| Administrator | Full system access |
| Fleet Manager | Assigned group data and reports |
| Driver | Own HOS logs, routes, performance |
| Mechanic | Maintenance schedules, vehicle health |

### Notification Strategy
- **Configurable alert rules** per user/role
- **Multi-channel delivery** (in-app, email, SMS)
- **Severity levels** (critical vs informational)

---

## 5. Compliance & Security

### Regulatory Requirements
- **DOT/FMCSA (U.S.)**: ELD mandate, IFTA fuel tax, DVIR inspections
- **GDPR**: Driver location/behavior is personal data (transparency + control)
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption (TLS 1.2+), MFA, regular penetration testing

### Industry Standards
- ELD self-certification on FMCSA registry
- IFTA automated distance calculations per jurisdiction
- Digital DVIR workflow for pre/post-trip inspections

---

## 6. Success Metrics & KPIs

### Operational KPIs
- **Cost reduction**: Fuel cost/mile, maintenance cost/vehicle, reduced overtime
- **Productivity**: Vehicle utilization %, jobs/day, on-time performance
- **Safety**: Speeding events, harsh driving events/1000 miles, HOS violations, CSA scores
- **Sustainability**: Idle time %, CO2 emissions

### ROI Measurement
- Target ROI: 6-12 months payback period
- Example: 10% fuel cost reduction for mid-sized fleet = tens of thousands annually

---

## Codebase Context

### Current Project Status
This is a **budget-first agentic workflow template** focused on:
- Token-aware command orchestration
- Automated workflow tracking
- Knowledge persistence through structured documentation
- Tool delegation (Gemini MCP for docs, Codex MCP for implementation, Claude for architecture)

### No Existing Fleet Management Code Found
- **Search results**: No fleet/vehicle/driver management code in current codebase
- **Conclusion**: This would be a greenfield implementation if pursued

### Relevant Template Assets
- **Workflow commands**: `.claude/commands/` (scout, plan, build, test, deploy)
- **Documentation structure**: `app-docs/` for specs/guides, `ai-docs/` for generated artifacts
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` for automation (workflow-status.js, unified-dashboard.js, etc.)

## Risks & Open Questions

### Technical Risks
1. **Real-time data volume**: Handling thousands of devices reporting every few seconds requires careful architecture
2. **Integration complexity**: GPS hardware diversity requires adapter patterns
3. **Mobile offline mode**: Ensuring data consistency when connectivity is intermittent
4. **ELD compliance**: FMCSA self-certification is complex and requires legal/technical expertise

### Business Risks
1. **Regulatory changes**: DOT/FMCSA rules evolve; system must be maintained
2. **Market competition**: Mature players (Samsara, Geotab, Verizon Connect) dominate
3. **Data privacy**: GDPR compliance for driver tracking requires ongoing vigilance

### Open Questions for User
1. **Target market**: Small fleets (<50 vehicles) vs enterprise (1000+)?
2. **Industry vertical**: General purpose, trucking, last-mile delivery, service vehicles?
3. **Build vs buy**: Custom platform or integrate with existing providers?
4. **Compliance scope**: U.S. only (DOT/FMCSA) or international (EU regulations)?
5. **MVP timeline**: What's the minimum viable feature set for launch?
