# Cross-Session Prompt

## Active Focus
- Maintain Claude $20 plan efficiency by keeping daily usage under 167K tokens.
- Route simple document summarization to Gemini MCP and UI/code tweaks to Codex MCP.

## Carry-Over Notes
- Workflow dashboard is emptyâ€”kick off a new feature with `/scout` or `/quick` once priorities are set.
- Sync after every command so `status-index.json` reflects in-flight work.

## Pending Follow-Ups
- Document recurring token usage patterns inside `ai-docs/logs/workflow-metrics.jsonl`.
- Backfill tasks into `ai-docs/workflow/tasks.json` for richer budget-aware recommendations.
