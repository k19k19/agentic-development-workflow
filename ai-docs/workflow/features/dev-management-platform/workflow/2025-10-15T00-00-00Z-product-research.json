    "Hybrid model dominates: project-based for acquisition, retainer for MRR stability",
    "Hourly rates: $90-250/hr; Fixed-price MVPs: $20K-75K; Retainers: $2K-15K/month",

    "What % of revenue is spent on sales/marketing for this agency size?",
    "How much do rates vary by geography (US/Canada/Europe/Asia)?",
    "Do technology specializations (AI/ML, blockchain) command rate premiums?"
