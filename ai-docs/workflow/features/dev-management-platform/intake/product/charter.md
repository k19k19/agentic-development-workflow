# Product Charter: Development Management Platform

**Feature ID:** `dev-management-platform`
**Charter Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** Initial Draft

---

## Vision Statement

A full-stack software development management platform that empowers agencies and development teams to:
- **Track customer deadlines** with confidence and transparency
- **Manage development costs** in real-time with accurate forecasting
- **Automate progress billing** to eliminate manual invoicing overhead

This platform bridges the gap between project execution and financial sustainability, providing agency owners, developers, and clients with the visibility and automation needed to deliver on-time, on-budget projects profitably.

---

## Target Market & Positioning

**Primary Target:** Small to mid-sized software development agencies (2-50 people) that:
- Manage multiple concurrent client projects
- Struggle with profitability due to scope creep and poor cost visibility
- Waste significant time on manual invoicing and client reporting

**Differentiation:** Unlike generic project management tools (Jira, Asana) or standalone accounting software (QuickBooks), this platform unifies deadline tracking, cost management, and automated billing in a workflow designed specifically for software development agencies.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

### Technical
1. **Data Security:** Must implement end-to-end encryption, GDPR compliance, and SOC 2 readiness
2. **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Secure data isolation between agencies
3. **Mobile Responsiveness:** All core features accessible on mobile devices
4. **API-First Design:** Extensible integration layer for third-party tools

### Business
1. **SaaS Pricing Model:** Monthly subscription with tiered pricing (starter, professional, enterprise)
2. **Self-Service Onboarding:** New users can start a trial and complete setup without sales calls
3. **Freemium Consideration:** Evaluate whether a free tier (1 project, 2 users) accelerates adoption

### Operational
1. **99.5% Uptime SLA:** Critical for client-facing billing operations
2. **Automated Backups:** Daily backups with point-in-time recovery
3. **Support Coverage:** Email support within 24 hours for all plans

## Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Complex Third-Party Integrations** | High | Start MVP with Stripe + one accounting integration; build flexible API layer |
| **Market Saturation** | High | Focus on niche (dev agencies) and unique value prop (billing automation) |
| **User Adoption Resistance** | Medium | Intuitive onboarding, import from existing tools, demonstrate immediate ROI |
| **Invoicing Disputes** | Medium | Milestone approval workflow in client portal before invoice generation |
| **Scope Creep in Development** | Medium | Use phased rollout (MVP → V2 → V3) with strict feature prioritization |

---

## Open Questions & Dependencies

**Must Answer Before Planning:**

1. **Target Market Priority:** Should MVP target solo freelancers, small agencies (2-10), or mid-sized consultancies (10-50)?
   - *Recommended:* Small agencies (2-10) for best product-market fit

2. **Billing Model Priority:** Which billing structure to support first: Time & Materials, Fixed-Price, or Retainers?
   - *Recommendation needed from stakeholders*

3. **Integration Priority:** Which integrations are table stakes for MVP?
   - Version control: GitHub vs. GitLab vs. both?
   - Accounting: QuickBooks vs. Xero vs. FreshBooks?
   - Payment: Stripe only, or also PayPal/Square?

4. **Cost Tracking Granularity:** Track costs per-task, per-developer, per-project-phase, or all three?
   - *Impact on database design and UX complexity*

5. **Dispute Resolution Workflow:** What happens when a client disputes a milestone completion or invoice?
   - Manual admin override?
   - Automated hold on payment processing?

6. **Pricing Strategy:** Per-user, per-project, percentage of transaction volume, or hybrid?
   - *Needs competitive analysis and revenue modeling*

## Initial Man-Hour Estimate

Based on the complexity heuristics in `app-docs/guides/product-charter-effort-estimates.md`:

| Capability | Complexity | Baseline Hours | Overhead Multiplier | Optimistic | Most Likely | Buffer (25%) |
|------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Unified Dashboard | Medium | 32 | 1.35 (discovery + validation) | 32 | 43 | 11 |
| Milestone & Deadline Tracking | Large | 80 | 1.45 (discovery + external reviews) | 90 | 116 | 29 |
| Cost Management | Large | 72 | 1.45 | 81 | 104 | 26 |
| Automated Billing | Large | 96 | 1.55 (discovery + validation + reviews) | 112 | 149 | 37 |
| Client Portal | Medium | 40 | 1.35 | 45 | 54 | 14 |
| Developer Time Tracking | Medium | 48 | 1.35 (Git integration) | 54 | 65 | 16 |
| Financial Reporting | Medium | 32 | 1.25 (validation) | 30 | 40 | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | | **400** | | **444** | **571** | **143** |

**Estimate Summary:**
- **Optimistic Path:** 444 hours (~11 weeks at 40 hrs/week)
- **Most Likely:** 571 hours (~14 weeks)
- **With Buffer:** 714 hours (~18 weeks)

**Assumptions:**
- Cross-functional pair (developer + designer) working collaboratively
- No major architectural rewrites during implementation
- One primary payment gateway integration (Stripe)
- One accounting system integration (QuickBooks or Xero)
- Assumes basic CI/CD and testing infrastructure already exists

**Triggers for Re-estimation:**
- Additional payment gateway or accounting integrations required
- Security compliance audit requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA)
- Multi-currency or international tax handling
- Mobile native apps (vs. responsive web only)

**Estimation Date:** 2025-10-15
**Estimated By:** AI Product Charter Process
