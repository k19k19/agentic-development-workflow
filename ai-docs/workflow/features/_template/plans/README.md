# Plans

Store `/baw:plan` output and research docs here. Create timestamped directories (`<timestamp>-<slice>/plan.md`) and register each slice in `checklist.json` with status updates as work progresses. When new discoveries surface during `/baw:scout`, enrich the active plan file and checklist entry instead of drafting a parallel planâ€”note the follow-up in `sessions/session-backlog.json` until the slice is ready for `/baw:build`.
