# Session Notes

Record daily progress in `SESSION-YYYYMMDD.md`. Each entry should include:

- Plans tackled and their status.
- Build/report artifacts created.
- Outstanding tasks added to `session-backlog.json`.
- Required plan revisions (when `/baw_dev_discovery` surfaced new information) and where the updates were recorded.

Update `session-backlog.json` at the end of each session so the next contributor can resume without rerunning intake or discovery prompts.
