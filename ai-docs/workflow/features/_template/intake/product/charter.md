# Product Charter

Use `/baw_product_charter` to populate each section. Keep revisions append-only so the decision trail
remains auditable.

## Vision & Value Proposition

_Summarize who the product serves, the pains addressed, and the outcomes delivered._

## Personas & Primary Jobs-to-be-Done

| Persona | Goals | Pains Today | Success Signals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Success Metrics

_List the KPIs or qualitative signals that prove the product is working._

## Core Capabilities

_Capture the minimum lovable feature set, dependencies, and non-negotiable constraints._

## Open Questions & Risks

_Log discovery gaps, regulatory constraints, and stakeholder approvals still pending._

## Initial Man-Hour Estimate

Use the heuristics in `app-docs/guides/product-charter-effort-estimates.md` to provide a lightweight
estimate so stakeholders can evaluate project viability early.

| Capability / Workstream | Complexity (S/M/L) | Assumptions & Notes | Optimistic Hours | Most Likely Hours | Buffer (Contingency) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

_Document the estimation date, contributors, and next recalibration trigger._
