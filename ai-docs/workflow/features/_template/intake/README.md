# Intake Workspace

Use this directory to capture discovery artifacts that feed the delivery workflow. Each subfolder aligns
with the `/baw:` command taxonomy so research, requirements, and persona-specific insights remain co-located
with the feature.

- `requirements.md` – seed specifications gathered during kickoff or `baw:dev_feature_start`.
- `product/` – product strategy outputs (`/baw:product_charter`, `/baw:product_features`, `/baw:product_wishlist`, `/baw:product_helper`).
- `personas/` – persona-specific operational notes (e.g., `/baw:provider_functions`).
- `support/` – ticket reviews, bug triage summaries, and customer feedback.
- `tasks/` – breakout task dossiers generated by `/baw:dev_execution_prep`.

Keep the structure intact when copying the template so automation can route artifacts to the correct folders.
