# Task Intake Notes

Use this folder to capture structured task preparation outputs generated by `/baw_dev_execution_prep`.
Each breakout should live in its own markdown file with:
- Summary and objective
- Owners and stakeholders
- Acceptance criteria and validation hooks
- Links to supporting documents or data sources

Keep filenames prefixed with the plan slice or module they support so the build history stays traceable.
