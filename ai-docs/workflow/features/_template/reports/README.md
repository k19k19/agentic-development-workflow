# Reports

Automation and manual summaries land here. Subdirectories align with `/baw:` commands:

- `scout/` – verification summaries and follow-up notes.
- `tests/` – raw test output and coverage snapshots.
- `test-matrices/` – `/baw:dev_test_matrix` deliverables.
- `uat/` – user acceptance test evidence and screenshots.
- `deployments/` – staging/production deployment logs.
- `review/` – code critiques and approval notes.
- `failures/` – failure analyses from `/baw:report_failure`.
- `ops/` – workflow radar dashboards and leadership digests.

Use timestamped filenames (e.g., `20250112T1530-core-auth.md`) and link back to the relevant plan checklist IDs.
