# Plans

Store `/plan` output and research docs here. Name plans using `PLAN-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` and register each slice in `checklist.json` with status updates as work progresses. When new discoveries surface during `/scout`, enrich the active plan file and checklist entry instead of drafting a parallel planâ€”note the follow-up in `sessions/session-backlog.json` until the slice is ready for `/build`.
