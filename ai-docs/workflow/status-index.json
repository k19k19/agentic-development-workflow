        "what": "Locked in a zero-legacy hygiene standard by pairing a knowledge-ledger mandate with an automated scanner that flags dormant code paths and stale documentation.",
        "why": "Leftover implementations and outdated references made subsequent work brittle and eroded trust in the docs; embedding the rule in governance keeps every feature surgically tidy.",
        "how": "`ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/KL-008-code-hygiene-enforcement.md` anchors the policy, `ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/legacy-scan.config.json` curates markers and allowlists, and `scripts/maintenance/legacy-scan.js` (via `npm run baw:maintenance:legacy-scan`) blocks drift during local and CI checks.",
