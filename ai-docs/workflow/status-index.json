        "what": "Established a constitution-style knowledge ledger with a canonical index and individual `KL-` decision files.",
        "why": "Prevent future iterations from discarding hard-earned context by requiring every adopted implementation to document its rationale and approach.",
        "how": "`ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/README.md` defines the governance loop, `ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/ledger.md` tracks adopted decisions, and `ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/KL-001-knowledge-ledger-governance.md` captures the full decision record."

        "adoptedOn": "2024-05-04",
        "what": "Linked the knowledge ledger to the workflow status index so the dashboard and status sync commands surface adopted decisions alongside feature progress.",
        "why": "Ensure project monitoring tools consistently reference the ledger as the single source of truth, preventing later iterations from ignoring established implementations.",
        "how": "`scripts/utils/knowledge-ledger.js` parses `ledger.md`, `scripts/workflow-status.js` embeds the parsed summary in `status-index.json`, and both `scripts/update-workflow-status.js` and `scripts/unified-dashboard.js` report ledger coverage during status checks."
