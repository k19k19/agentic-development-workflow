# Session Notes

**Purpose**: Store production workflow session summaries for AI memory persistence.

## Structure

Each session note captures:
- **Task/Feature**: What was implemented
- **Workflow**: Which commands were executed (/scout, /plan, /build, etc.)
- **Files Modified**: Git diff summary
- **Token Usage**: Efficiency metrics
- **Decisions Made**: Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Issues Encountered**: Problems and their resolutions
- **Next Steps**: Follow-up tasks or improvements

## Naming Convention

```
SESSION-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[feature-slug].md
```

Examples:
- `SESSION-2025-10-10-user-auth.md`
- `SESSION-2025-10-11-payment-integration.md`

## Automatic Generation

Session summaries are automatically generated by:
- `/build` command (brief summary)
- `/build_w_report` command (detailed summary)
- `/full` command (complete workflow summary)

## Why This Matters

**AI Memory Persistence**: Without session notes, each new Claude Code session starts with zero context about past work. Session notes enable:

1. **Cross-session learning**: AI can reference past decisions
2. **Pattern discovery**: Find similar implementations
3. **Context efficiency**: Load only relevant past context, not entire codebase
4. **Decision continuity**: Understand why certain approaches were chosen

## Best Practices

### What to Include
✅ High-level decisions (architecture, patterns, libraries)
✅ Token efficiency metrics
✅ Problems encountered and solutions
✅ Trade-offs and alternatives considered
✅ Follow-up tasks identified

### What to Exclude
❌ Line-by-line code explanations (use git history)
❌ Full file contents (use source files)
❌ Repetitive information (link to existing docs)
❌ Temporary debugging notes (use git branches)

## Template Structure

```markdown
# Session: [Feature Name]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Workflow**: /scout → /plan → /build_w_report
**Status**: ✅ Complete | ⏸️ In Progress | ❌ Blocked

## Task Summary
[1-2 sentences describing what was built]

## Workflow Execution
- **Scout**: [findings summary]
- **Plan**: [approach summary]
- **Build**: [implementation summary]

## Files Modified
[git diff --stat output]

## Key Decisions
1. **[Decision]**: [Why and what alternatives were considered]
2. **[Decision]**: [Why and what alternatives were considered]

## Issues & Resolutions
- **Issue**: [Problem description]
  - **Resolution**: [How it was solved]

## Token Metrics
- Scout: ~XK tokens
- Plan: ~XK tokens
- Build: ~XK tokens
- Total: ~XK tokens
- Efficiency: X%

## Follow-up Tasks
- [ ] [Task 1]
- [ ] [Task 2]
