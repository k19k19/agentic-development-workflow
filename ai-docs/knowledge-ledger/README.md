# Knowledge Ledger

Use this when you learn something worth remembering between sessions. Each markdown file becomes searchable once you run `npm run vectorize`.

Recommended fields:
- Problem solved / decision made
- Links to specs or source files
- Tags (feature names, domains)

The validation script keeps things tidy:
```bash
npm run knowledge:validate
```

Everything here is optionalâ€”keep it lightweight and let commands guide the workflow.
