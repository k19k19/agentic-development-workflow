# Knowledge Ledger

Use this when you learn something worth remembering between sessions. Keep notes concise so future agents can scan them quickly.

Recommended fields:
- Problem solved / decision made
- Links to specs or source files
- Tags (feature names, domains)

Everything here is optionalâ€”keep it lightweight and let commands guide the workflow.
