## Summary

Formalize a constitution-style knowledge ledger so that every adopted implementation records its problem statement, rationale, and realization in one canonical place.

## Rationale

Why this approach was chosen:

- **Alternative A**: Keep ad-hoc notes in session summaries — Those artifacts are transient and quickly buried, making it hard to audit why a past version behaved a certain way.
- **Alternative B**: Expand specs only — Specs track desired behavior, but they do not explain the actual implementation decisions or what superseded them.
- **Chosen Approach**: Maintain a dedicated ledger with traceable `KL-` records — This provides an append-only history where adopted decisions cannot be silently replaced, forcing successors to address prior context explicitly.

### Trade-offs

- **Pros**:
  - Creates a single, easily discoverable record for institutional knowledge.
  - Encourages disciplined documentation of rationale and implementation details.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires ongoing maintenance discipline to keep `ledger.md` synchronized with `KL-` files.
  - Adds upfront documentation effort when adopting new work.

### Key Factors

- Desire for a durable "constitution" capturing what is truly in force.
- Need to prevent later iterations from forgetting or rewriting history without justification.

## Implementation

Where to find this decision in the codebase:

### Files
- `ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/README.md` – Describes the governance process for proposals, adoption, and supersession.
- `ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/ledger.md` – Serves as the canonical index of adopted decisions and their why/how summaries.
- `ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/KL-001-knowledge-ledger-governance.md` – Full decision record anchoring the ledger system.

### Commands
```bash
# Run when auditing knowledge assets
npm run baw:knowledge:manage -- list
```

### Configuration
_No configuration changes required._

## Validation

How we know this works:

### Tests
- ✅ Manual review to ensure the ledger process documents what, why, and how for this change.

### Metrics
- Not applicable at this stage.

### User Feedback
- Feedback pending future iterations that adopt this process.

## Future

Conditions that might trigger reconsideration:

- If the ledger becomes too large to scan quickly, consider generating an automated summary view while preserving the canonical markdown source.
- If adoption discipline slips, integrate checks in CI to ensure new `KL-` entries update `ledger.md` before merging.
