# Build Workflow

**Token Budget**: 50K (Hybrid delegation across Gemini, Codex, Claude)
**Model**: claude-sonnet-4-5 (orchestrator)
**Purpose**: Execute implementation plan with optimal tool delegation

---

## Input Requirements

1. `PLAN_FILE_PATH`: Path to plan file created by plan phase
2. Implicit: Access to all MCP tools (gemini, codex, playwright, shadcn, firecrawl)

---

## Pre-Build Validation (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY code changes:**

1. **Verify Plan Exists**
   ```
   - Read plan file from PLAN_FILE_PATH
   - Confirm all phases are defined
   - Check token budget allocation
   ```

2. **Git Safety Check**
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   # If dirty: warn user about uncommitted changes
   git diff --stat
   # Baseline for post-build comparison
   ```

3. **Dependency Check**
   ```bash
   # Check if required tools are available
   - Verify MCP tools in .mcp/ config
   - Check package.json for dependencies
   - Validate environment variables if needed
   ```

4. **Create Build Branch** (for large changes)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b build/[task-slug]-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
   ```

---

## Build Process

### Phase 0: Setup (2K tokens)

1. **Initialize Build Tracking**
   ```
   - Create ai-docs/builds/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-[task-slug].log
   - Start token counter
   - Initialize task checklist
   ```

2. **Load Context from Plan**
   ```
   - Parse implementation phases
   - Extract tool delegation strategy
   - Identify file dependencies
   ```

### Phase 1-N: Execute Implementation Tasks

For each task in plan:

#### Task Execution Loop

1. **Pre-Task Check**
   ```
   - Mark task as in_progress in build log
   - Verify dependencies completed
   - Load required files (with offset/limit from plan)
   ```

2. **Tool Selection & Delegation**

   **Option A: Codex MCP** (for syntax, boilerplate, UI/UX)
   ```bash
   # Use MCP tool for Codex
   <use codex-mcp-tool>
   Task: [specific task description]
   Files: [files to modify]
   Context: [minimal context from plan]
   </use>
   ```

   **Option B: Gemini MCP** (for docs, configs, simple transformations)
   ```bash
   # Use MCP tool for Gemini
   <use gemini-mcp-tool>
   Task: [specific task description]
   Model: gemini-2.5-flash (for speed) or gemini-2.5-pro (for complexity)
   Context: [documentation summaries]
   </use>
   ```

   **Option C: Claude (self)** (for complex logic, multi-file integration)
   ```
   - Use Edit tool for precise changes
   - Use Write tool for new files
   - Use Read tool for context
   - Maintain full architectural awareness
   ```

   **Option D: Playwright MCP** (for testing)
   ```bash
   # Generate and run tests
   <use playwright-mcp-tool>
   Test: [test scenario]
   Component: [component to test]
   </use>
   ```

   **Option E: Shadcn** (for UI components)
   ```bash
   # Add/modify UI components
   <use shadcn-mcp-tool>
   Component: [component name]
   Variant: [variant if needed]
   </use>
   ```

3. **Validation After Each Task**
   ```
   - Syntax check (linter if available)
   - Quick manual test if applicable
   - Git diff to verify changes
   - Mark task as completed in build log
   ```

4. **Token Tracking**
   ```
   - Log actual tokens used
   - Compare to plan estimate
   - Alert if 80% of budget consumed
   ```

## Tool Delegation Decision Tree

```
START
  â†“
Is it a single file syntax fix?
  YES â†’ Codex MCP
  NO â†’ Continue
  â†“
Is it documentation or config?
  YES â†’ Gemini MCP
  NO â†’ Continue
  â†“
Is it UI component work?
  YES â†’ Codex MCP (UI/UX specialty) + Shadcn MCP
  NO â†’ Continue
  â†“
Is it multi-file with complex logic?
  YES â†’ Claude (self)
  NO â†’ Continue
  â†“
Is it testing?
  YES â†’ Playwright MCP + Codex MCP
  NO â†’ Default to Claude
```

---

## Parallel vs Sequential Execution

### Run in Parallel When:
- Tasks have no dependencies
- Working on different files
- Independent feature additions

```
Example:
Task 1: Add API endpoint A (file: api/endpoint-a.js)
Task 2: Add API endpoint B (file: api/endpoint-b.js)
â†’ Delegate both to Codex MCP in parallel
```

### Run Sequentially When:
- Task B depends on Task A output
- Modifying same file
- Database migration + code changes

```
Example:
Task 1: Update database schema
Task 2: Update model to reflect schema
â†’ Execute Task 1, then Task 2
```

---

## Error Handling

### Tool Failures

1. **Codex MCP timeout/error**
   ```
   - Log failure
   - Retry once with simplified prompt
   - If fails again â†’ Escalate to Claude
   ```

2. **Gemini MCP error**
   ```
   - Fall back to Claude for documentation tasks
   - Use WebFetch as alternative for URL content
   ```

3. **Syntax errors from delegated tools**
   ```
   - Run linter
   - Use Codex MCP to fix syntax
   - Don't let Claude manually fix (delegate!)
   ```

### Build Failures

1. **Test failures**
   ```
   - Identify failing component
   - Re-run with Playwright MCP in debug mode
   - Fix and re-test
   ```

2. **Integration errors**
   ```
   - Review multi-file changes
   - Use Claude to analyze integration points
   - Fix with appropriate tool
   ```

3. **Token budget exceeded**
   ```
   - Stop build
   - Save progress to build log
   - Report to user with options:
     a) Continue with reduced scope
     b) Pause and resume later
     c) Simplify remaining tasks
   ```

---

## Post-Build Actions

### Step 1: Validation

1. **Automated Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test  # or pytest, or appropriate test command
   ```

2. **Linting**
   ```bash
   npm run lint  # or appropriate linter
   ```

3. **Build Check**
   ```bash
   npm run build  # verify build succeeds
   ```

4. **Git Safety**
   ```bash
   git diff --stat
   # Verify only intended files changed
   # No unintended modifications from MCP tools
   ```

### Step 2: Documentation Updates

Use Gemini MCP to update:
- `app-docs/mappings/` with new feature-to-source relationships
- `app-docs/architecture/` if structural changes made
- README.md if new commands/features added

### Step 3: Build Report

Write to: `ai-docs/builds/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-[task-slug]-report.md`

```markdown
# Build Report: [Task Name]

**Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Duration**: [Actual time]
**Token Usage**: [Actual vs Planned]

## Summary
[2-3 sentences on what was built]

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Task 1 (Tool: Codex, Tokens: 2K)
- [x] Task 2 (Tool: Claude, Tokens: 8K)
- ...

## Files Modified
- path/to/file1.js (+50, -10)
- path/to/file2.js (+120, -5)

## Tests Added/Modified
- test/file1.test.js (12 tests, all passing)

## Deviations from Plan
- [Describe any changes from original plan]
- [Why deviations occurred]

## Token Budget

| Gemini MCP | 3 | 8K | 100% |
| Claude | 4 | 22K | 100% |

## Known Issues
- [Any issues discovered during build]
- [Workarounds applied]

## Next Steps
- [ ] Manual testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Deployment planning
```

### Step 4: Cleanup

1. **Reset if needed**
   ```bash
   # If build failed and user wants to reset:
   git reset --hard HEAD
   git clean -fd
   ```

2. **Commit if successful**
   ```bash
   # Only if user approves:
   git add [modified files]
   git commit -m "feat: [task summary]

   Implementation plan: ai-docs/plans/[plan-file]
   Build report: ai-docs/builds/[report-file]

## Integration with Report Phase

The report phase will:
1. Read this build report
2. Summarize for user (using Gemini MCP)
3. Generate next steps
4. Update project documentation
5. Archive plan and build files
