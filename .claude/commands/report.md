# Report Phase: Build Summary & Documentation

**Token Budget**: 5K (Gemini for fast summarization)
**Model**: gemini-2.5-flash (delegated via MCP)
**Purpose**: Summarize build, update docs, generate next steps

---

## Arguments

1. `BUILD_REPORT_PATH`: Path to build report from build phase

---

## Report Generation

### Step 1: Read Build Artifacts (1K tokens)

**Use Task tool with Gemini MCP:**

```
Use Task tool:
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  description: "Read and parse build artifacts"
  prompt: |
    TOOL: Use Gemini MCP for efficient reading

    READ these files:
    1. {BUILD_REPORT_PATH}
    2. ai-docs/plans/[corresponding-plan].md (extract from report)
    3. Git log: last commit if committed

    EXTRACT:
    - Task completion status
    - Files changed (count and paths)
    - Test results
    - Token usage (planned vs actual)
    - Tool performance metrics
    - Known issues discovered
    - Deviations from plan

    RETURN: Structured summary (JSON format preferred)
```

### Step 2: Generate Executive Summary (2K tokens)

**Use Task tool with Gemini MCP:**

```
Use Task tool:
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  description: "Generate executive summary"
  prompt: |
    TOOL: Use Gemini MCP for summarization

    INPUT: [Structured summary from Step 1]

    GENERATE: Executive summary following this format:

    # Build Summary: [Task Name]

    ## Status: ‚úÖ Success / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial / ‚ùå Failed

    **Completed**: [date/time]
    **Duration**: [actual time]
    **Token Efficiency**: [actual/planned]%

    ### What Was Built
    - [3-5 bullet points of user-facing changes]

    ### Quality Metrics
    - Files: [count] modified ([additions], [deletions] lines)
    - Tests: [passing]/[total] ([percentage]% coverage)
    - Linting: [pass/fail]
    - Build: [pass/fail]
    - Performance: [metrics]

    ### Token Usage
    | Phase | Planned | Actual | Efficiency |
    |-------|---------|--------|------------|
    | Scout | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z]% |
    | Plan | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z]% |
    | Build | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z]% |
    | Report | [X]K | [Y]K | [Z]% |
    | **Total** | **[X]K** | **[Y]K** | **[Z]%** |

    ### Tool Performance
    - Codex MCP: [tasks], [success rate]%, [avg tokens/task]
    - Gemini MCP: [tasks], [success rate]%, [avg tokens/task]
    - Claude: [tasks], [success rate]%, [avg tokens/task]
    - Other tools: [summary]

    Keep it concise (max 300 words).
```

### Step 3: Update Documentation (1.5K tokens)

**Use Task tool with Gemini MCP for doc updates:**

```
Use Task tool:
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  description: "Update project documentation"
  prompt: |
    TOOL: Use Gemini MCP

    BASED ON: Build report from {BUILD_REPORT_PATH}

    UPDATE these files:

    1. app-docs/mappings/feature-to-source.md
       - Add new feature mappings
       - Format: | Feature | API | Database | Files |
       - Extract from build report's "Files Modified" section

    2. app-docs/architecture/[relevant-doc].md (if structural changes)
       - Update architecture diagrams (describe changes)
       - Document new patterns introduced

    3. app-docs/debugging/known-issues.md
       - Add any issues from build report's "Known Issues" section
       - Include workarounds

    RETURN: List of updated files with summaries of changes
```

**Implementation:**

After receiving Gemini's response, use Edit tool to apply updates:

```markdown
For each file to update:

1. Read current file
2. Apply Gemini's suggested changes using Edit tool
3. Verify format consistency
4. Mark as updated
```

### Step 4: Generate Next Steps (0.5K tokens)

**Use Task tool with Gemini MCP:**

```
Use Task tool:
  subagent_type: general-purpose
  description: "Generate actionable next steps"
  prompt: |
    TOOL: Use Gemini MCP

    BASED ON: Build report and plan file

    GENERATE: Prioritized next steps in 3 categories

    ### Immediate (Required before deployment)
    - [ ] [Action item with specific details]
    - [ ] [Action item]

    ### Short-term (This week)
    - [ ] [Action item]
    - [ ] [Action item]

    ### Long-term (Backlog)
    - [ ] [Action item based on known issues]
    - [ ] [Optimization opportunity]

    CRITERIA:
    - Immediate: Blockers, critical tests, security
    - Short-term: Enhancements, additional tests
    - Long-term: Optimizations, refactoring

    Max 10 items total.
```

- [‚úÖ] app-docs/mappings/feature-to-source.md - Added feature mapping
- [‚úÖ] app-docs/debugging/known-issues.md - Added pagination note
- [‚úÖ] README.md - Documented new API endpoints

---

## Known Issues

### Issues Discovered
1. **Performance with large datasets** (Priority: Low)
   - Impact: fetchAll() may be slow with >10K records
   - Workaround: None currently
   - Future fix: Add pagination (backlog)

### Risks Mitigated
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes - None introduced
- ‚úÖ Auth integration - Feature-flagged, tested
- ‚úÖ Database migration - Rollback tested

---

## Next Steps

[From Step 4 - Gemini generated next steps]

### Immediate (Required)
- [ ] Code review by team lead
- [ ] Manual testing of all endpoints
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Validate in staging (smoke tests)

### Short-term (This Week)
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Performance testing with realistic data
- [ ] Security audit (auth flows)
- [ ] Update monitoring dashboards

### Long-term (Backlog)
- [ ] Add pagination to fetchAll() method
- [ ] Explore caching strategy for read-heavy endpoints
- [ ] Consider rate limiting per user
- [ ] Add metrics/telemetry

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ‚úÖ
1. **Multi-agent scout**: Found all relevant files efficiently
2. **Codex for boilerplate**: Saved significant Claude tokens
3. **Gemini for docs**: Fast and accurate documentation updates
4. **Pre-implementation approval**: Caught potential issue early

### What Could Improve ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Plan phase token estimate**: Slightly underestimated service complexity (+1.2K tokens)
   - Future: Add 15% buffer for complex business logic
2. **Parallel execution**: Only 2 tasks ran in parallel (could have done more)
   - Future: Better identify independent tasks in plan

### Recommendations for Next Workflow üöÄ
1. Use Codex MCP for all CRUD endpoints (proven efficient)
2. Keep Claude for complex integration logic only
3. Add 15% buffer to token estimates for new patterns
4. Identify more parallel execution opportunities in planning
