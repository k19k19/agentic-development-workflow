# Quick (Budget Shortcut)

## Purpose
Direct implementation for small, well-understood tasks using Codex MCP. Bypasses scout/plan phases for maximum speed and minimal token usage (~5K tokens).

## Variables
TASK: $1

## Instructions
- **When to use**: Small projects (<10 files), simple single-file changes, well-understood patterns.
- **When NOT to use**: Complex features, multi-file changes, architectural decisions.
- If `TASK` is missing, stop and ask the user to provide it.
- Use Codex MCP directly to implement the task.
- Run tests automatically after implementation.
- No approval gates - assume task is straightforward.

## Workflow
1. Validate `TASK` is provided and suitable for quick mode.
2. Use `mcp__codex__codex` tool to implement the task directly.
3. Run tests using `npm test` or appropriate test command.
4. Report results with token usage.

## Report
- List files created/modified.
- Show test results.
- Display token usage (~5K target).
- Provide quick validation command (e.g., `curl` for API endpoints).

## Budget
~5K tokens (Codex MCP)
