# /baw:dev_discovery

## Purpose
Collect the most relevant code, documentation, and prior automation outputs needed to understand the feature described in `USER_PROMPT`.

## Variables
USER_PROMPT: $1

## Instructions
- **Delegate Analysis**: Use Gemini MCP (`mcp__gemini-cli__ask-gemini`) to analyze the `USER_PROMPT` and generate a list of optimal `rg` search keywords and relevant file globs.
- **Execute Search**: Use the keywords and globs from Gemini to search the codebase with `rg`. Only fall back to `find` or `grep` if `rg` is unavailable.
- Review `ai-docs/workflow/features/` for prior status entries related to the same feature. Always append discoveries to the existing
  feature workspace instead of starting a parallel thread.
- Capture enough context for the planning phase: existing implementations, shared utilities, constraints, and open questions.
## Workflow
1. Parse `USER_PROMPT` to identify primary feature areas and constraints.
2. Inspect documentation (`app-docs/`, `ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/`, relevant specs) for background details.
3. Search the codebase with `rg` to surface candidate files and read the important sections (only fall back to other tools if `rg` is not installed).
4. Summarize discoveries, highlighting reusable code, gaps, and risks that the plan must address.
5. Record any documentation that should be updated before continuing. When the goal is to gather structured specs from subject
   matter experts, note those gaps so `/baw:dev_execution_prep` can focus on that follow-up instead of re-running discovery here.

## Report
- Provide bullet summaries of the most relevant files and excerpts discovered.
- List any documentation or specs the user should review or update.
- Call out risks, unknowns, or follow-up questions uncovered during discovery.
- If this run is clarifying an approved plan slice, explicitly point to the existing feature workspace plan under
  `ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/plans/` to update rather than suggesting a new feature or plan file.
- Note: Token usage will be automatically captured if using `complete-auto` command.

## Automation Trace
- Emit a workflow status JSON entry following `app-docs/guides/workflow-status-format.md`.
  - Derive `featureId` from the request title in kebab-case. When the feature workspace already exists, reuse that slug.
  - Save to `ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/workflow/<ISO-timestamp>-dev-discovery.json`.
  - Use `phase: "discovery"` and set `status` to `completed`, `needs_docs`, or `blocked` as appropriate.
  - Set `nextCommand` to the exact follow-up slash command the user should run.
  - Include any documentation paths that must be updated before resuming.
- Remind the user to run `npm run baw:workflow:sync` so the dashboard reflects the new discovery results.

## Next Steps
After completing discovery, you typically want to:

**â†’ Create an implementation plan:**
```bash
/baw:dev_plan "[your-task]" "[doc-urls]" "[discovery-notes-path]"
```

Where `[discovery-notes-path]` is the file path shown in the discovery output.

If the plan already exists, remind the user to append the new context to the same plan document and checklist entry.

**Short circuit:**
```bash
/baw:dev_discovery_build "[your-task]"
```

When you hand off to the next command, summarize the available context and highlight any missing documentation the user should supply.
