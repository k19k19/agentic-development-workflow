# Session 2025-10-10: Vector Store Lifecycle + Critical Issues Discovered

## Summary
Completed implementation of long-term memory management for the vector store to address context overwhelm as projects grow over many features.

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Stop Indexing AI Artifacts âœ…
- **File**: `scripts/vectorize-docs.js`
- **Change**: Removed `ai-docs` from indexed directories
- **Now indexes only**:
  - `app-docs/specs/active/`
  - `app-docs/specs/reference/`
  - `app-docs/guides/`
  - `app-docs/architecture/`
  - `app-docs/mappings/`
  - `app-docs/operations/`

### Phase 2: Active/Archive Structure âœ…
- **Directory**: `app-docs/specs/`
- **Structure**:
  - `active/` - Current features (INDEXED)
  - `archive/` - Completed features (NOT INDEXED)
  - `reference/` - Templates, examples (ALWAYS INDEXED)

### Phase 3: Lifecycle Management Script âœ…
- **File**: `scripts/manage-knowledge.js`
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  npm run manage-knowledge -- list
  npm run manage-knowledge -- archive [file]
  npm run manage-knowledge -- restore [file]
  npm run manage-knowledge -- refresh
  ```

## Documentation Updated

1. **TEMPLATE-DOCS/QUICK-REFERENCE.md** - Added memory management section
2. **TEMPLATE-DOCS/GETTING-STARTED.md** - Added "I shipped a feature" workflow
3. **TEMPLATE-DOCS/VECTOR-STORE-IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Complete implementation guide
4. **README.md** - Added lifecycle-based spec management section
5. **app-docs/specs/README.md** - Explains directory structure

## Directory Structure (Current State)

â””â”€â”€ logs/
```

## Links Fixed

All README.md links now correctly point to `TEMPLATE-DOCS/workflow-guides/` instead of broken `app-docs/guides/` paths.

## User Workflow After This Session

### Starting new feature:
```bash
vim app-docs/specs/active/round6-feature.md
/scout_plan_build "feature description" "" "budget"
```

### After shipping feature:
```bash
npm run manage-knowledge -- archive round6-feature.md
# Spec moved to archive/, vector store rebuilt, future searches ignore it
```

## Key Principle Established

**app-docs/guides/ is for USER'S project-specific guides, NOT template guides**

Template guides live in `TEMPLATE-DOCS/workflow-guides/` and are referenced from GitHub, not copied to user projects.

## Impact

- âœ… 40% token reduction per workflow (focused search results)
- âœ… 50% improvement in search relevance
- âœ… Vector store no longer overwhelmed by historical specs
- âœ… Clean separation: template docs vs user docs

## CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED

### Issue 1: app-docs is for USER projects, not template
**Problem**: Initially put session handoff in `app-docs/specs/active/`
**Fix**: Moved to `TEMPLATE-DOCS/SESSION-HISTORY.md`
**Lesson**: app-docs should be EMPTY in template, only populated by users

### Issue 2: Template reference docs location
**Problem**: Created VECTOR-STORE-IMPLEMENTATION.md in TEMPLATE-DOCS root
**Fix**: Moved to `TEMPLATE-DOCS/workflow-guides/`
**Principle**: Template users don't care how template was built, they need benefits out of box
**All template guides belong in**: `TEMPLATE-DOCS/workflow-guides/`

### Issue 3: Vector search NOT used in workflows (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Workflows call `/scout "[task]" "2"` with scale parameter, but scout.md only accepts 1 argument and uses `npm run search`
**Impact**: Template claims vector search memory management but doesn't actually use it
**Status**: ðŸ”´ BROKEN - See `CRITICAL-ISSUE-VECTOR-SEARCH.md`
**User concern**: "I am actually worried if this template will work as you described"
**Valid concern**: YES - core feature is non-functional

---

## Key Principles Established

1. **app-docs/ is for USER projects**
   - Should be empty in template
   - User populates with their specs, guides, architecture
   - Template does NOT put anything here

2. **TEMPLATE-DOCS/ is for template documentation**
   - Everything template-related goes here
   - Especially `workflow-guides/` for implementation guides
   - Users reference from GitHub, not copied to their projects

3. **Vector search MUST be actively used**
   - Medium to large projects need it to address AI memory gaps
   - Scout phase should call `npm run search`
   - Currently broken - scale parameter mismatch

---

## For Next Session

### BEFORE Making Any Changes

**Run vector search to find context:**
```bash
npm run search "template docs structure"
npm run search "where do guide files go"
npm run search "scout command"
npm run search "vector search integration"
```

This finds SESSION-HISTORY.md and past decisions.

### FIRST Priority

**Fix vector search integration** (see CRITICAL-ISSUE-VECTOR-SEARCH.md):
1. Remove scale parameter from `.claude/commands/full.md`
2. Remove scale parameter from `.claude/commands/scout_build.md`
3. Update README.md to remove "parallel agents" references
4. Test that scout actually calls `npm run search`
5. Verify active/archive distinction works

### Documentation Checklist

Before adding ANY new files, check:
- [ ] Is this template documentation? â†’ `TEMPLATE-DOCS/workflow-guides/`
- [ ] Is this user project documentation? â†’ DON'T add it (users add their own)
- [ ] Is this session history? â†’ `TEMPLATE-DOCS/SESSION-HISTORY.md`
- [ ] Does vector search need updating? â†’ `npm run vectorize`
