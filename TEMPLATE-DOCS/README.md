This directory contains documentation for **using this template**, not for your project.

**These files are NOT copied to user projects.** Users reference them via the GitHub repository when needed.

## User Projects

When you run `init-agentic-workflow.sh`, these files are **NOT** copied to your project.

Instead, you get:
- `app-docs/` - Empty folders with READMEs (for YOUR content)
- `ai-docs/` - Empty directory structure (populated when workflows run)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Auto-generated from `CLAUDE-TEMPLATE.md`
- `.claude/` - Slash commands
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts
