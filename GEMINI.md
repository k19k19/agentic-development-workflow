# GEMINI.md

Thin context file for the Gemini MCP tool. Keep it short and project-specific.

- Describe how Gemini should help (docs summarization, quick research, etc.).
- List any API keys or CLI commands in `app-docs/operations/` instead of here.
- No template references or generic playbooksâ€”focus on your project.

If Gemini isn't part of your workflow, you can delete this file.
