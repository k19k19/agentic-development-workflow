# Analysis of the Existing "Budget Agentic Workflow" Template

The existing "Budget Agentic Workflow" template is quite comprehensive and solves critical problems in agentic software development, namely traceability, context preservation, and budget control. It achieves this through a structured command system, dedicated feature workspaces, and a formal knowledge ledger.

However, its strength—its structured nature—can also be a source of complexity. A world-class replacement should aim for the same goals but with a much lower barrier to entry and greater flexibility.

Here is a proposal for a new template design from scratch, which I'll call the "Evolving Agentic Workspace" (EAW).

## Core Philosophy: Progressive Disclosure & Convention over Configuration
The EAW's guiding principle is to start simple and add structure only as a task's complexity demands it. Instead of scaffolding a large, intimidating directory structure for every initiative, the workspace evolves organically. This makes it lightweight for small tasks (like bug fixes) but robust enough for large epics.


## Proposed README.md for the "Evolving Agentic Workspace"
Here is what the main EAW-README.md for this new template might look like. It introduces the core concepts and workflow.


## Why This Design is a Better Replacement
Drastically Lower Cognitive Load: Instead of dozens of /baw:... commands and a complex directory structure, the user only needs to remember /agent. The system is conversational and context-aware, guiding the user through sub-commands (plan, code, test).
Flexible and Adaptive: It gracefully handles both a 5-minute bug fix and a 3-month epic. The "progressive disclosure" of directories (plan/, discovery/) prevents the user from being overwhelmed by empty folders and unnecessary structure.
Organic Knowledge Capture: The Knowledge Base is built as a natural byproduct of completing work, not as a separate, formal process. Asking "What did we learn?" at the end of a task is a simple yet powerful mechanism for retaining context. This is more user-friendly than the formal KL- system.
Cleaner Project Root: All agentic activity is namespaced under a single workspace/ directory (which can be git-ignored) and a hidden .agent/ configuration directory. This keeps the project's primary file tree clean and focused on the source code itself.
Human-Readable History: A top-level CHANGELOG.md provides an immediate, high-level overview of progress, which is more accessible to managers and team members than parsing JSON status files or a dashboard.
This "Evolving Agentic Workspace" design achieves the same goals of traceability and context preservation but does so with a user-centric, conversation-driven approach that is easier to adopt, simpler to use, and more adaptable to the reality of varied software development tasks.


## "Evolving Agentic Workspace" (EAW) template is designed to handle the scale and complexity of a two-year-long SaaS project.

The EAW is built on principles of simplicity, progressive disclosure, and organic knowledge capture. These are not just for small tasks; they are fundamental to managing long-term complexity without succumbing to documentation overhead or process fatigue.

Here’s how the EAW would support your multi-year, multi-team SaaS project:

1. Managing Longevity and Project Scale (2+ Years)
A long-running project's biggest enemies are knowledge decay and a cluttered workspace. The EAW addresses this directly.

Clean Work Queue: The workspace/tasks/ directory only contains active work. Once a task is completed, /agent finish moves it to workspace/archive/. This ensures that developers and the agent are always focused on what's current, preventing the workspace from becoming an unmanageable graveyard of old tasks. After two years, you'll have a clean list of ongoing work and a comprehensive, searchable archive.
High-Level Project History: The root CHANGELOG.md becomes the project's official timeline. Every time a task is finished, a one-line summary is appended. Over two years, this file provides an invaluable, high-level history of every feature shipped, bug fixed, and piece of research completed, making it easy for anyone to understand the project's velocity and evolution.
Long-Term Memory: The workspace/knowledge/ directory is the project's "constitution." It's not a log of everything, but a curated set of foundational decisions. When a task to "Choose a payment provider" is completed, the agent's prompt ("Were there any key decisions...that the team should remember?") leads to the creation of K-005-use-stripe-for-payments.md. This prevents the team from re-litigating settled decisions a year later and serves as the ultimate source of truth for architectural principles. This is a more organic and sustainable process than the formal KL- system in the original template.

2. Supporting Cross-Functional Teams (Product, Dev, Ops, Support)
The EAW's single, conversational entry point (/agent) unifies the workflow for all teams, while the agent's contextual questions route the work appropriately.

Product Team: A Product Manager can initiate discovery work without needing to know developer commands.

Command: /agent start "Define requirements for V2 of the admin dashboard"
Agent Interaction: The agent asks if this is research or a feature plan. The PM works with the agent to create requirement documents, user stories, and mockups, which are saved within the task folder (e.g., workspace/tasks/TASK-042-admin-dashboard-v2/). This task is now a self-contained package ready for developer handoff.
Development Team: Developers pick up tasks from the workspace/tasks/ queue.

Command: /agent code --task TASK-042
Agent Interaction: The agent loads the context from TASK-042-admin-dashboard-v2, including the PM's requirements. The developer then uses the plan, code, and test sub-commands to implement the feature. The entire history, from requirement to implementation, is contained in one place.
Support & Operations Teams: These teams can use the same system to manage their work, ensuring it's visible and actionable.

Support Example: /agent start "Bug: User cannot reset password in Safari"
The agent guides the support engineer to provide logs and replication steps, creating a task like TASK-043-safari-password-reset-bug. This task is now in the queue for a developer to triage.
Ops Example: /agent start "Create Q4 deployment runbook"
The agent helps the Ops engineer generate checklists and scripts, which are stored in the task folder. When the deployment is done, /agent finish logs the successful deployment to the CHANGELOG.md.

3. Ensuring End-to-End Traceability
The fatal flaw of many large projects is the inability to trace a piece of code back to its original requirement or a decision back to its rationale. The EAW is designed to make this effortless.

Requirement to Code: When a developer commits code for TASK-042, the commit message would be feat: Add new widgets to admin dashboard (refs TASK-042). Now, you have a direct link from the Git history back to the task folder, which contains the original product requirements, the technical plan, and the entire conversation that led to the final code.
Problem to Solution: For the password bug (TASK-043), the task folder contains the initial user report from support, the developer's investigation (session.log), the code changes, the tests that were written, and the final resolution. This provides a complete audit trail for any incident.

In summary, the Evolving Agentic Workspace is not just a replacement; it's a philosophical shift. By prioritizing a simple, conversational interface and an adaptive structure, it provides a scalable and resilient framework that will effectively support a complex, multi-year SaaS project across all its teams.
