# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

## Repository Purpose

This is a **budget-first agentic development workflow template** designed to maximize efficiency through:
- Token-aware command orchestration via slash commands
- Automated workflow status tracking and session management
- Knowledge persistence through structured documentation
- Tool delegation strategy (Gemini MCP for docs, Codex MCP for implementation, Claude for architecture)

The workflow is built around self-documenting slash commands that enforce automation hooks, emit machine-readable status JSON, and maintain cross-session continuity without relying on external documentation.

---

## Core Architecture

### Slash Command System
All engineering work flows through commands in `.claude/commands/*.md`. They are organized around three persona tracks:

**Product + Strategy:**
- `/baw:product_charter [product]` â€“ Define personas, value proposition, and metrics.
- `/baw:product_features [product]` â€“ Catalog core features with dependencies and readiness signals.
- `/baw:product_wishlist [product]` â€“ Capture stretch ideas and activation triggers.
- `/baw:product_helper [topic]` â€“ Run targeted research to close discovery gaps.

**Developer Delivery:**
- `/baw:dev_dependency_plan [initiative]` â€“ Sequence milestones based on dependencies.
- `/baw:dev_breakout_plan [phase]` â€“ Shape sprint-sized breakout increments.
- `/baw:task_prep [task]` â€“ Gather specs, acceptance criteria, and owners for implementation.
- `/baw:dev_test_matrix [release]` â€“ Define verification strategy across environments.
- `/baw:dev_deploy_plan [release]` â€“ Produce deployment/rollback runbooks.
- `/baw:quick [task]`, `/baw:scout_build [task]`, `/baw:full [task] [docs] [mode]` â€“ Implementation accelerators using Codex MCP.

**Operations + Support:**
- `/baw:workflow_radar [initiative]` â€“ Visualize blockers and missing documentation by persona.
- `/baw:provider_functions [product]` â€“ Map provider/admin workflows and operational requirements.
- `/baw:support_ticket [queue]` â€“ Convert support feedback into prioritized actions.
- `/baw:verify_scout`, `/baw:pause_feature`, `/baw:restart_feature`, `/baw:report_failure`, `/baw:hotfix`, `/baw:triage_bug`, `/baw:next` â€“ Guardrails, recovery, and triage utilities.

All implementation phases rely on Codex MCP (`mcp__codex__codex`) for code edits. Claude orchestrates the workflow, reviews Codex output, and handles approvals/communication.

**Workflow Phases:**
- Discovery: `/baw:product_charter`, `/baw:product_features`, `/baw:product_wishlist`, `/baw:product_helper`
- Planning: `/baw:start`, `/baw:scout`, `/baw:plan`, `/baw:dev_dependency_plan`, `/baw:dev_breakout_plan`, `/baw:task_prep`
- Implementation: `/baw:build`, `/baw:build_w_report`, `/baw:quick`, `/baw:scout_build`
- Verification: `/baw:dev_test_matrix`, `/baw:test`, `/baw:uat`, `/baw:report_failure`
- Deployment: `/baw:dev_deploy_plan`, `/baw:deploy_staging`, `/baw:finalize`, `/baw:release`
- Operations: `/baw:workflow_radar`, `/baw:provider_functions`, `/baw:support_ticket`, `/baw:triage_bug`, `/baw:hotfix`

### Scout-to-Plan Feedback Loop

- When a `/baw:scout` result is too thin to execute an approved plan slice, **re-run `/baw:scout` against the same feature workspace** instead of creating a new feature. Reference the active plan under `ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/plans/` and append new findings in-place.
- Promote all clarified requirements into the existing `plans/checklist.json` entry inside the feature workspace by updating its notes, acceptance criteria, or dependencies. Never spawn a second plan slice just to hold the extra data.
- Use the feature workspace session backlog to flag "Plan needs revision" so subsequent prompts continue refining the same artifact until it is executable.
- Only call `/baw:plan` again if the scope materially changes and the old plan entry is supersededâ€”record the supersession inside `plans/checklist.json`.

**Scout vs Task Prep**
- `/baw:scout` performs discoveryâ€”gather code/document context and risks. Its outputs live in `reports/scout/` and update the matching plan slice.
- `/baw:task_prep` is the actionizerâ€”turn a planned slice into an executable checklist with owners, validation hooks, and missing assets. Store those dossiers in `intake/tasks/` and keep them synced with the plan checklist entry.

### Workflow Status System
Every command writes structured JSON to `ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/workflow/<timestamp>-<phase>.json` containing:
```javascript
{
  featureId: "kebab-case-id",
  featureTitle: "Human Title",
  phase: "scout|plan|build|test|deploy",
  status: "pending|in_progress|needs_validation|blocked|completed",
  command: "the slash command that ran",
  nextCommand: "recommended follow-up command",
  summary: "one-sentence status",
  outputPath: "path to main artifact",
  documentation: ["paths to docs"],
  timestamp: "ISO-8601"
}
```

**Key scripts:**
- `npm run baw:workflow:sync` â€“ Aggregates status JSON â†’ `ai-docs/workflow/status-index.json`
- `npm run baw:work` â€“ Renders unified dashboard from status index
- `npm run baw:session:start` â€“ Shows token budget + recommended tasks

## Command Patterns

### When User Provides Plain Request
1. Map request to appropriate slash command based on scope:
   - Single file/simple change â†’ `/baw:quick "[task]"`
   - Medium task (10-50 files) â†’ `/baw:scout_build "[task]"`
   - Large feature (>50 files) â†’ `/baw:full "[task]" "" "budget"`
2. Ask if you should execute the command
3. Only proceed after user confirmation
4. When a command enters an implementation phase, immediately delegate edits to Codex MCP and keep Claude focused on oversight and reporting.

### Command Execution Flow
1. **Before command:** Read existing feature spec from `app-docs/specs/active/` if it exists
2. **During command:** Follow the command's markdown instructions precisely
3. **After command:**
   - Write workflow status JSON to `ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/workflow/<timestamp>-<phase>.json`
   - Update session log in `ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/sessions/SESSION-<date>-<slug>.md`
   - Remind user to run `npm run baw:workflow:sync`
   - Print verification message for approval gates:
     ```
     ðŸ›‘ Still inside /baw:<command>. Reply 'resume' to continue or 'stop' to exit.
     [Explain what happens on resume]
     ```
   - Show **Next Steps** section with literal commands to run

### Budget Mode Behavior
When mode parameter is `"budget"` or prompt contains `[BUDGET MODE]`:
- Skip external documentation scraping unless URL explicitly provided
- Limit plan to ~350 words
- Use concise section structure: Summary, Key Steps (max 4), Risks, Tests
- Set scout scale to 2 agents (vs 4 in standard mode)

## Key Implementation Details

### Feature ID Generation
Convert feature titles to kebab-case:
```javascript
// "Add JWT Auth" â†’ "add-jwt-auth"
title.toLowerCase()
  .replace(/[^a-z0-9\s-]/g, '')
  .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
  .replace(/-+/g, '-')
  .trim()
```

### Workflow Status Validation
`scripts/workflow-status.js` enforces required fields:
- `featureId`, `featureTitle`, `phase`, `status`, `command` (all strings)
- `documentation` (array of strings)
- Skips invalid entries with warnings

### Knowledge Ledger Integration
`scripts/utils/knowledge-ledger.js` parses `ai-docs/knowledge-ledger/ledger.md` for architectural decisions:
- Adopted decisions (active patterns)
- Superseded decisions (historical context)
- Auto-integrated into status index

### Token Budget Tracking
`scripts/utils/token-usage-analyzer.js` tracks usage by:
- Daily limit: 200K tokens (Claude $20 plan)
- Weekly rolling window
- Per-model breakdown (Gemini/Codex vs Claude)
- Efficiency warnings at 70% (ðŸŸ ) and 90% (ðŸ”´)

---

## Tool Delegation Strategy

**Use Gemini MCP for:**
- Reading/summarizing documentation URLs
- Quick documentation searches
- Format conversions

**Use Codex MCP for:**
- Small single-file implementations (`/baw:quick`)
- CRUD boilerplate
- UI component tweaks
- Syntax fixes

**Use Claude (Sonnet 4.5) for:**
- Multi-agent orchestration (`/baw:scout` â†’ `/baw:plan` â†’ `/baw:build` workflows)
- Architectural decisions
- Complex multi-file refactoring
- Plan verification and approval gates

---

## Verification & Approval Gates

Commands that pause for approval:
1. `/baw:plan` â€“ After plan written, before `/baw:build`
2. `/baw:full` â€“ After plan phase, before build phase
3. `/baw:verify_scout` â€“ After scout, if confidence <70%

**Always:**
- Print clear pause message with `ðŸ›‘` emoji
- Explain what resume will do
- Wait for explicit "resume" or "stop" from user
- Never skip approval even if task seems simple

---

## Session Memory Pattern

After each build/baw:test cycle:
1. Run `git diff --stat` to show files changed
2. Write or update `ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/sessions/SESSION-[date]-[slug].md` with:
   - Task summary (1-2 sentences)
   - Files modified
   - Key decisions and rationale
   - Validation highlights
   - Follow-up tasks for next agent
3. Emit workflow status JSON
4. Prompt `npm run baw:workflow:sync`
5. Suggest next command (usually `/baw:test`)

---

## ESLint Configuration

Uses flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`):
- Extends `@eslint/js` recommended
- Ignores: `node_modules/`, `ai-docs/**`, config file itself
- Language: CommonJS, ES2021, Node + Browser globals
- Repository uses `eslint . --fix` for auto-fixing

---

## Git Workflow

After implementation:
1. Show `git diff --stat`
2. Point to session log: `ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/sessions/SESSION-*.md`
3. Suggest commit only after tests pass
4. Use commit format:
   ```
   feat: Add feature title (spec: app-docs/specs/...)

   Implementation plan: ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/plans/<timestamp>-*/plan.md
   Build report: ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/reports/...

   - Key change 1
   - Key change 2

## Common Pitfalls

**DON'T:**
- Skip pre-approval gates "for efficiency"
- Read entire directories (use scout + feature-to-source.md)
- Commit without running tests
- Create new files when editing existing ones suffices
- Batch multiple todo completions (mark done immediately)
- Skip workflow status JSON emission
- Forget to remind user about `npm run baw:workflow:sync`

**DO:**
- Check `app-docs/guides/workflow-status-format.md` before writing status JSON
- Read `app-docs/specs/active/` for existing feature context
- Update `app-docs/mappings/feature-to-source.md` when files change
- Use `npm run baw:session:start` at session start for budget awareness
- Delegate appropriately (Gemini for docs, Codex for boilerplate, Claude for complexity)

---

## Testing Notes

When `/baw:test` command runs:
- Executes test suite (method depends on project)
- Captures output to `ai-docs/workflow/features/<feature-id>/builds/[timestamp]/test-output.txt`
- Analyzes results
- Suggests next action:
  - Pass â†’ `/baw:deploy_staging`
  - Fail â†’ Fix issues, rerun `/baw:test`
- Never proceed to deployment if tests fail

---

## Adoption by Other Projects

This template can be installed via:
```bash
bash /path/to/template/scripts/init-agentic-workflow.sh
```

What it does:
- Copies `.claude/` commands + `scripts/` utilities
- Creates empty `app-docs/` and `ai-docs/` scaffolding
- Merges `package.json` scripts + dependencies
- Updates `.gitignore`
- Seeds workflow status index
- Prints exact next command to run

**Does NOT copy:** Template documentation (only runtime assets)

---

## Reference Documentation

For deeper understanding:
- `app-docs/guides/workflow-status-format.md` â€“ Status JSON schema
- `app-docs/guides/` â€“ Implementation patterns (populated by user)
- `README.md` â€“ Quick start guide for end users
- `.claude/commands/*.md` â€“ Full command specifications

This codebase is optimized for token efficiency, cross-session continuity, and self-documenting automation. When in doubt, follow the slash command flow and let the scripts handle bookkeeping.
