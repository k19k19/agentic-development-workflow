Agentic Development Workflow

Claude.md

Organize folders into:
1. ai docs
2. app docs
3. app
4. specs
5. root is uncluttered and only contains working folders and config files like package.json, .mcp config, claude.md

Philosophy: R and D framework. Reduce and Delegate
 Key highlights:
- Scout-Plan-Build workflow with multiple parallel agents
- Custom slash commands that compose and chain together
- Dedicated agent devices running autonomous workflows
- Context engineering with the R&D framework (Reduce and Delegate)
- Real-time migration of 8 custom agents to the new Claude Agent SDK
- Building OpenAI Agent SDK prototypes with web search and function tools
