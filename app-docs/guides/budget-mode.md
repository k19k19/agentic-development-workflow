# Budget Mode Workflow

Budget Mode keeps the multi-agent pipeline affordable when you live on the $20 Claude plan, $20 ChatGPT plan, and Gemini free tier. Use it whenever you are touching one or two files, applying documentation updates, or iterating on an existing feature.

## When To Enable
- Small deltas or follow-up fixes (e.g., lint cleanups, copy edits, quick bug fixes).
- Iterating on a feature that already has a plan in `ai-docs/`.
- Any task where the scout output is obvious and you already know the target files.

## How To Run
```bash
# Minimal run: scout with reduced scale, concise plan
/scout_plan_build "<prompt>" "" "budget"
```
- Scout drops to scale 2 and appends `[BUDGET MODE]` so down-stream agents keep their responses short.
- The plan command limits itself to a ~350-word summary with four key steps.
- Generator, Researcher, and Coordinator agents already understand `budget=true` and will avoid unnecessary tests, refactors, or follow-up requests.

## Manual Tips
- Reuse previous plans stored in `ai-docs/` rather than rerunning the full workflow.
- Cap `npm run search` with `--limit=3`; expand only if you fail to find the right doc.
- Prefer Gemini or local shell tools for reconnaissance, then switch to Claude or GPT for final reasoning.
- If the work ever exceeds three files or requires new architecture decisions, exit Budget Mode and run the standard pipeline.

Budget Mode is about keeping velocity high without blowing through tokensâ€”flip it on by default and opt into the heavier loop only when the task truly demands it.
