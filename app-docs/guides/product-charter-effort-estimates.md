# Using the Product Charter to Draft Man-Hour Estimates

A product charter captures why the initiative matters, who it serves, and the
capabilities that must exist to deliver value. When stakeholders are deciding
whether to fund the work, translate those charter insights into a lightweight
man-hour estimate using the workflow below.

## 1. Collect Inputs
- The latest charter stored under `ai-docs/charter.md`.
- Any discovery notes generated by `/baw_product_helper` that clarify unknowns.
- Historical velocity or benchmark data from previous initiatives (if available).

## 2. Break Capabilities Into Estimable Units
1. Review the **Core Capabilities** and **Personas** sections of the charter.
2. For each capability, note the primary user journey and the minimum lovable
   scope expected at launch.
3. Map each capability to an estimable workstream (e.g., onboarding flow,
   analytics instrumentation, compliance review). Use `/baw_product_capabilities`
   if the workstreams are unclear.

## 3. Assign Complexity Buckets
Use the following heuristics to tag each workstream before translating it into
hours:

| Complexity | Typical Characteristics | Baseline Build Hours* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small | Minor UX/content change, limited integration work | 8–16 |
| Medium | Net-new flow with one integration or data model change | 24–40 |
| Large | Multi-surface experience, new infrastructure, or heavy compliance | 60–96 |

> \*Baseline hours represent hands-on implementation time for one
> cross-functional pair (designer + engineer). Adjust the number if your team
> has a different definition of Small/Medium/Large.

## 4. Layer on Discovery and Validation
For each workstream, add the following overhead unless the charter already
provides completed research:
- **Discovery / Research:** +20% if open questions or regulatory gaps remain.
- **Validation / Testing:** +15% when new integrations or high-risk workflows
  are involved.
- **Coordination / Reviews:** +10% if external stakeholders (legal, security,
  partner teams) must sign off.

These percentages stack; e.g., a medium workstream with outstanding discovery
and external reviews would be `baseline * 1.45`.

## 5. Capture Optimistic, Most Likely, and Buffer Hours
1. Set the **Most Likely Hours** to the baseline build hours multiplied by the
   applicable overhead percentages.
2. Define **Optimistic Hours** as 0.75 × Most Likely to show the best-case path
   when unknowns resolve quickly.
3. Use **Buffer (Contingency)** = 0.25 × Most Likely to cover hidden
   dependencies, context switching, or support requests.
4. Record these values in the `Initial Man-Hour Estimate` table inside the
   charter template.

## 6. Summarize at the Charter Level
- Sum the optimistic, most likely, and buffer columns to produce a total range.
- Highlight assumptions and trigger points that would change the estimate
  (e.g., "integration partner exposes OAuth scopes by 05/01").
- Note the estimation date and responsible contributors so stakeholders know
  when to request updates.

## 7. Keep the Estimate Fresh
- Revisit the table after running `/baw_dev_dependency_plan` or
  `/baw_dev_breakout_plan`; replace high-variance assumptions with concrete
  tickets.
- When the estimate changes materially (±15%), append a new dated subsection
  rather than rewriting history.

Following this process gives customers enough information to decide whether to
continue without over-investing in detailed planning before they commit.
