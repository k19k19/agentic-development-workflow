Documentation task? ‚Üí Gemini MCP
Multi-file + logic? ‚Üí Claude
Testing? ‚Üí Playwright MCP
```

**This applies to EVERY project, so it's in user memory.**

## üîç Side-by-Side Examples

### Example 1: Code Quality

**User Memory (Universal):**
```markdown
## Code Quality Standards

- File size: Target 300-500 lines
- Tests: >80% coverage
- Security: Input validation, parameterized queries
- Organization: Separation of concerns
```

**Project CLAUDE.md (Specific):**
```markdown
## Code Quality for IoT Analytics

- Service classes: app/services/*.js
- Test files: app/services/*.test.js
- Current coverage: 87% (target: >80% ‚úÖ)
- Linting: ESLint with Airbnb style
```

### Example 2: Documentation

**User Memory (Universal):**
```markdown
## Documentation Standards

Every project needs:
- CLAUDE.md (project memory)
- README.md (setup, usage)
- app-docs/specs/ (features)
- app-docs/guides/ (patterns)
```

**Project CLAUDE.md (Specific):**
```markdown
## Documentation Hub

- Specs: app-docs/specs/authentication.md
- API Docs: app-docs/architecture/API-ENDPOINTS.md
- Feature Map: app-docs/mappings/feature-to-source.md
- Debugging: app-docs/debugging/known-issues.md
```

### Example 3: Workflows

**User Memory (Universal):**
```markdown
## Workflow Selection

Small projects (<10 files):
  ‚Üí Direct implementation (~10K tokens)

Medium projects (10-50 files):
  ‚Üí /scout_build (~40K tokens)

Large projects (>50 files):
  ‚Üí /scout_plan_build_report (~95K tokens)
```

**Project CLAUDE.md (Specific):**
```markdown
## Project Scale: LARGE (>50 files)

Recommended workflow: /scout_plan_build_report

Quick commands:
  npm run dev        # Start IoT gateway + web server
  npm test           # Run test suite
  node scripts/send-gps-data.js  # Test GPS ingestion
```

## üéØ Quick Decision Guide

### Ask yourself: "Does this apply to ALL my projects?"

**YES ‚Üí User Memory**
- Tool delegation rules
- Pre-implementation protocol
- Code quality standards
- Git commit format
- Debugging process
- Security checklist

**NO ‚Üí Project CLAUDE.md**
- This project's architecture
- File locations in THIS project
- Commands for THIS project
- Tech stack of THIS project
- Current status of THIS project

## üìù Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Setup User Memory (One Time)

1. **Copy universal principles:**
   ```bash
   cp USER-MEMORY-CLAUDE.md ~/claude-user-memory.md
   ```

2. **Add to Claude Code global settings:**
   - Open Claude Code settings
   - Find "User Memory" or "Global Project Memory"
   - Paste contents of `USER-MEMORY-CLAUDE.md`

3. **Update quarterly:**
   - Review every 3 months
   - Add new patterns learned
   - Update tool delegation if needed

### Step 2: Setup Project Memory (Per Project)

1. **Copy template to project:**
   ```bash
   cp CLAUDE-TEMPLATE.md ~/my-project/CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. **Customize for project:**
   - Replace `[Project Name]`
   - Update "Architecture Summary"
   - Add project-specific commands
   - Update "Current Project State"

3. **Update per feature:**
   - Update after significant changes
   - Keep "Recent Changes" current
   - Link to new documentation

## üîÑ Maintenance

### User Memory Updates

**When to update:**
- ‚úÖ Learned a new universal pattern
- ‚úÖ Found better tool delegation strategy
- ‚úÖ Discovered new debugging technique
- ‚úÖ Updated workflow decision logic

**How often:**
- Quarterly review (every 3 months)
- Or after major learnings

### Project Memory Updates

**When to update:**
- ‚úÖ After each feature implementation
- ‚úÖ Architecture changes
- ‚úÖ New documentation added
- ‚úÖ Tech stack changes
- ‚úÖ Known issues discovered

**How often:**
- After major features
- Weekly for active projects
- `/report` phase can auto-update some sections

## ‚ö° Pro Tips

### 1. Start with User Memory

Set up your user memory ONCE, use across all projects:
```bash
# Setup global principles (one time)
1. Copy USER-MEMORY-CLAUDE.md to Claude settings
2. Done! Works for all projects now.
```

### 2. Clone Project Memory

For each new project:
```bash
# Quick project setup
cp ~/templates/agentic-workflow/CLAUDE-TEMPLATE.md ~/new-project/CLAUDE.md
# Edit new-project/CLAUDE.md with project specifics
```

### 3. Keep User Memory DRY

If you find yourself copying the same text to multiple project CLAUDE.md files ‚Üí **Move it to user memory!**

**Example:**
```
Found in 3 project CLAUDE.md files:
"Always validate input with Joi schema"

‚Üí Move to USER-MEMORY-CLAUDE.md under "Security Standards"
‚Üí Remove from individual projects
```

### 4. Reference, Don't Duplicate

In project CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD:
"See user memory for tool delegation rules. This project uses the standard approach."

‚ùå BAD:
[Copies entire tool delegation section from user memory]
```

---

## üìö Real-World Example

### Your IoT Analytics Project

**In USER-MEMORY-CLAUDE.md (Global):**
```markdown
## Pre-Implementation Protocol

Before ANY code changes:
1. Read app-docs/specs/ (via Gemini)
2. Check app-docs/mappings/
3. Confirm approach with user
4. WAIT for approval

## Tool Delegation

Boilerplate ‚Üí Codex MCP
Documentation ‚Üí Gemini MCP
Complex logic ‚Üí Claude
```

**In ~/iot-analytics-app/CLAUDE.md (Project-Specific):**
```markdown
## IoT Analytics App

**Architecture**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io + SQLite

**Services:**
- IoT Gateway (port 4003): GPS protocol handlers
- Web Service (port 3003): REST API + WebSocket

**Quick Commands:**
```bash
node backend/app.js              # Combined mode
node backend/iot-gateway-service.js  # Gateway only
```

**Known Issues:**
- Port 80 conflict: Run `sudo apachectl stop`
- String concatenation bug: Fixed in commit abc123

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 (60% complete)
```

- [x] Contains NO project-specific commands
- [x] Contains NO architecture specific to one project
- [x] ALL content applies to EVERY project you work on
- [x] Changes infrequently (quarterly updates)

### Project CLAUDE.md is Correct When:

- [x] Contains THIS project's architecture
- [x] Contains THIS project's file locations
- [x] Contains THIS project's commands
- [x] References user memory for universal rules
- [x] Updates frequently (weekly or per feature)

## üéâ Summary

**User Memory = The Rules of the Game**
- How to play (tool delegation, workflows)
- What's always true (standards, protocols)
- Universal strategies (debugging, optimization)

**Project CLAUDE.md = The Current Game State**
- What's on the board (architecture, files)
- Special moves (project commands, patterns)
- Score and status (current phase, known issues)

**Together they enable:**
- ‚úÖ Consistency across all projects (from user memory)
- ‚úÖ Project-specific efficiency (from project CLAUDE.md)
- ‚úÖ 90%+ token efficiency (both working together)
- ‚úÖ Handle multiple enterprise projects simultaneously
